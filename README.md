# Setup instructions

## Configuring SSL
Because Beiwe often deals with sensitive data covered under HIPAA, it's important to add an SSL certificate so that web traffic is encrypted with HTTPS.

The setup script [uses AWS Certificate Manager to generate an SSL certificate](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request.html).  AWS Certificate Manager [will check that you control the domain by sending verification emails](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate.html) to the email addresses in the domain's WHOIS listing.
