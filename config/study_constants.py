    'The Beiwe application runs on your phone and helps researchers collect information about your '
    'behaviors. Beiwe may ask you to fill out short surveys or to record your voice. It may collect '
    'information about your location (using phone GPS) and how much you move (using phone '
    'accelerometer). Beiwe may also monitor how much you use your phone for calling and texting and '
    'keep track of the people you communicate with. Importantly, Beiwe never records the names or '
    'phone numbers of anyone you communicate with. While it can tell if you call the same person '
    'more than once, it does not know who that person is. Beiwe also does not record the content of '
    'your text messages or phone calls. Beiwe may keep track of the different Wi-Fi networks and '
    'Bluetooth devices around your phone, but the names of those networks are replaced with random '
    'codes.\n\nAlthough Beiwe collects large amounts of data, the data is processed to protect your '
    'privacy. This means that it does not know your name, your phone number, or anything else that '
    'could identify you. Beiwe only knows you by an identification number. Because Beiwe does not '
    'know who you are, it cannot communicate with your clinician if you are ill or in danger. '
    'Researchers will not review the data Beiwe collects until the end of the study. To make it '
    'easier for you to connect with your clinician, the \'Call my Clinician\' button appears at the '
    'bottom of every page.\n\nBeiwe was conceived and designed by Dr. Jukka-Pekka \'JP\' Onnela at '
    'the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Development of the Beiwe smartphone application '
    'and data analysis software is funded by NIH grant 1DP2MH103909-01 to Dr. Onnela. The smartphone '
    'application was built by Zagaran, Inc., in Cambridge, Massachusetts.'
